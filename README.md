# [ICML'25] MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents

This is the official implementation of [MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05174).

## Abstract

Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs.

## Installation
First, clone the [agentdojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo) repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo
```

Next, please follow the instructions in [agentdojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo) to install the agentdojo environment.

## MELON Implementation in AgentDojo

### Step 1: Add the interface

In `agentdojo/src/agentdojo/agent_pipeline/agent_pipeline.py`, add the interface of MELON.
```python
from agentdojo.agent_pipeline.pi_detector import MELON

...

DEFENSES = [
    "tool_filter",
    "transformers_pi_detector",
    "spotlighting_with_delimiting",
    "repeat_user_prompt",
    "melon",
]
```

In `def from_config` function, add the MELON detector (similar to `tool_filter` and other defenses).
```python

if config.defense == "melon":
    tools_loop = ToolsExecutionLoop(
        [
            ToolsExecutor(),
            ContrastPIDetector(
                llm,
                threshold=0.1,
            ),
        ]
    )
    
    pipeline = cls([system_message_component, init_query_component, llm, tools_loop])
    pipeline.name = f"{llm_name}-{config.defense}"
    return pipeline
```

## Step 2: Add the MELON detector

Please copy the entire `pi_detector.py` to `agentdojo/src/agentdojo/agent_pipeline/pi_detector.py`. Rememeber to fill in the api key for the OpenAI model.

Modifications:

1. In `class PromptInjectionDetector`, the `query` function is modified by adding the `is_injection` argument in the `extra_args` dictionary. This is used for stopping the agent's execution when an attack is detected.
2. The `class MELON` is added.

## Run the experiments
The instructions are the same as in [agentdojo](https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo).

Here is an example command to run the experiments:
```bash
python -m agentdojo.scripts.benchmark --model gpt-4o-2024-05-13 --attack tool_knowledge --defense melon -s slack > gpt-4o-2024-05-13_tool_knowledge_melon_slack.log
```

## MELON Implementation in Other Repositories

In `pi_detector.py`, we provide the implementation of MELON. You can use it in your own projects.
